# QuadcoptAR

With everyone stuck in their homes and me particularly being located in an area near a airport, many people in my position* may want to fly their drones but are unable fly near their homes and are also unable to travel to more drone friendly locations. To solve this problem, I came up with the idea to create a mobile application to allow people who have never flown a drone, or are otherwise incapable of flying a drone, to fly a drone in augmented reality allowing people to fly when/where they wouldn't normally be able to.

Instructions:
1. to begin using this application click the fly button which will make the drone ascend into the air
2. the left, right, forward, and back buttons control where the drone will fly to 
3. when you're finished click the land button and the drone will descend to the nearest plane directly below it

*This project was used as a submission to the HackDSC hackathon
 
*I don't have my own drone
