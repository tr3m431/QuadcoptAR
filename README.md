# QuadcoptAR

With everyone stuck in their homes and me particularly being located in an area near a airport, many people in my position* may want to fly their drones but are unable fly near their homes and are also unable to travel to more drone friendly locations. To solve this problem, I came up with the idea to create a mobile application to allow people who have never flown a drone, or are otherwise incapable of flying a drone, to fly a drone in augmented reality allowing people to fly when/where they wouldn't normally be able to.

*This project was used as a submission to the HackDSC hackathon
 
*I don't have my own drone
